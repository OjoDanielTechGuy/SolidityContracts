**Transfer Function In Ethereum**

Mostly due to its simplicity and straightforwardness. Here is a basic representation of how to use this function:

payable(msg.sender).transfer(address(this).balance);

We utilize msg.sender which refers to the address initiating the transaction. The transfer function is used to send the specified amount of Ether (or the native cryptocurrency on the current blockchain).
It is worth noting the necessity of converting the msg.sender to a payable address to facilitate the transfer. This is achieved by wrapping the msg.sender with the payable keyword.
However, transfer has a significant limitation. It can only use up to 2300 gas and it reverts any transaction that exceeds the gas limit. When your transaction requires more gas, this function fails and reverts the transaction entirely. Additionally, Solidity by example offers an excellent reference point for this discussion.

**Send Function**
-
Our second method is the send function. Syntax-wise, it is similar to transfer, but it has a slightly different behavior. Here is how you would write it:
bool success = payable(msg.sender).send(address(this).balance);
equire(success, "Send failed");

Similar to the transfer function, send also has a gas limit of 2300. However, instead of completely reverting the transaction, it returns a Boolean value (true or false) to indicate the success or failure of the transaction. In case of failure, the contract is still intact. It is your responsibility as a developer to ensure that errors are caught, which is the purpose of require(success, "Send failed");. This line of code enforces that the send operation must be successful.
**Call Function**
-
Finally, the call function is the most flexible and powerful of the three. It can be used to call virtually any function in Ethereum without requiring the function's abi (application binary interface). More importantly, it does not have a capped gas limit. It forwards all available gas to the transaction.
(bool success, ) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: address(this).balance}("");
require(success, "Call failed");

To send funds using the call function, we modify our syntax slightly by including squiggly brackets {'{'}...{'}'}, where we can add details about the transaction, such as the value being transacted.
The call function also returns two variables: a Boolean for success or failure, and a byte object which stores returned data if any. The code require(success, "Call failed"); ensures that the transaction must succeed, similar to the send method.
